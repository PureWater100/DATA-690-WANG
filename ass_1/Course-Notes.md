# Notes on Chapters 1 and 2 of "Python for Data Analysis"
## Chapter 1. Preliminaries 
- primary focus of this book is on structured data 
- Python for data analysis
- Python Libraries 
  - NumPy: Short for Numerical Python, for numerical data
  - Pandas" for structured/tabular data
  - matplotlib
  - IPython/Jupyter
  - Many Others...
- Installation and Setup 
  - Local:
    - Anaconda
  - Cloud Based:
    - Google Colab
    - Deepnote
    - Others...
- Use Python 3.6
- Goals:
  - *Interacting with the outside world*
    - Reading and writing with a variety of file formats and data stores 
  - *Preparation*
    - Cleaning, munging, combining, normalizing, reshaping, slicing and dicing, and transforming data for analysis
  - *Transformation*
    - Applying mathematical and statistical operations to groups of datasets to derive new datasets (e.g., aggregating a large table by group variables)
  - *Modeling and computation*
    - Connecting your data to statistical models, machine learning algorithms, or other computational tools 
  - *Presentation*
    - Creating interactive or static graphical visualizations or textual summaries
## Chapter 2. Python Language Basics, IPythom, and Jupyter Notebooks
- Python is an interpreted language, so an interpreter will run a program by executing one statement at a time
- IPython: an enhanced Python interpreter
- Jupyter notebook: web-based code notebooks originally created within the IPython project
- Running the IPython Shell:
  - use the ipython command
- Running the Jupyter Notebook:
  - Run the command jupyter notebook in a terminal 
  - file with extension .ipynb
- Introspection
  - using a question mark before or after a variable will display some general information about the object
- %run command 
  - runa ny file as a python program inside IPython session
  - in Jupyter notebook, can use the related %load magic function:
  - this imports a script into a code cell
- to interrupt running code, press Ctrl-C
- Code can be executed from the clipboard 
  - for Jupyter notebooks, you can copy and paste code into any cell and execute it
- Terminal Keyboard Shortcuts 
  - IPython has many keyboard shortcuts for navigating the prompt and interacting with the shell's command history
- Magic Commands
  - IPython's special commands (aren't built into Python itself) 
- Matplotlib Integration 
  - IPython integrates well with data visualization and other user interface libraries like matplotlib
### Python Language Basics 
- Brief overview of essential Python programming concepts and language mechanics
- "executable pseudocode"
- indentation, not braces
- uses whitespace (tabs or spaces) to structure code instead of using braces as in many other languages like R, C++, Java, and Perl
- use 4 spaces as default indentation
- statements do not need to be terminated by semicolons
  - semicolons can be used to separate multiple statements on a single line:
  - 'a = 5;  b = 6; c= 7'
- everything is an object 
- comments
  - use the hash mark/pound sign #
- function and object method calls 
  - call functions using parentheses and passing zero or more arguments, optionally assigning the returned value to a variable 
- variables and argument passing 
- possible to alter the internals of a mutatble argument
- In contrast with many compiled languages, like Java and C++, object references in Python have no type associated with them
- Duck typing: can verify that an object is iterable if it implemented the iterator protocol
- try using the iter function 
- imports
  - a module is a file with the.py extension containined code
  - to access the content of such a file, then just use the import command 
- binary operators and comparisons
- Mutable and immutatable objects
  - most objects can be modified 
  - but strings and tuples can't be tampered with 
- Scalar Types 
  - single value data types 
  - called scalars
  - types:
    - None 
    - str
    - bytes
    - float
    - bool
    - int 
  - numeric types 
    - primary types for numbers: int and float 
  - strings 
    - use single or double quotes
    - immutable
  - bytes and unicode
    - Unicode has become the first-class string type to enable more consistent handling of ASCII and non-ASCII text.
  - booleans
    - true and false
    - combined with the 'and' and 'or' keywords
  - type casting 
    - str, bool, int, and float types can be casted to values 
  - None 
    - null value type
    - doesn't explicitly return a value, implicitly returns None
  - Dates and Times 
    - built-in datetime module 
- Control Flow 
  - has several built-in keywords for conditional logic, loops, and other standard control flow concepts in other programming languages
  - if, elif, else
  - for loops
  - while loops
  - pass 
  - range
  - ternary expressions
