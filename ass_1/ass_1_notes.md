# Chapter 1 Notes
## Chapter 1. Preliminaries 
- primary focus of this book is on structured data 
- Python for data analysis
- Python Libraries 
  - NumPy: Short for Numerical Python, for numerical data
  - Pandas" for structured/tabular data
  - matplotlib
  - IPython/Jupyter
  - Many Others...
- Installation and Setup 
  - Local:
    - Anaconda
  - Cloud Based:
    - Google Colab
    - Deepnote
    - Others...
- Use Python 3.6
- Goals:
  - *Interacting with the outside world*
    - Reading and writing with a variety of file formats and data stores 
  - *Preparation*
    - Cleaning, munging, combining, normalizing, reshaping, slicing and dicing, and transforming data for analysis
  - *Transformation*
    - Applying mathematical and statistical operations to groups of datasets to derive new datasets (e.g., aggregating a large table by group variables)
  - *Modeling and computation*
    - Connecting your data to statistical models, machine learning algorithms, or other computational tools 
  - *Presentation*
    - Creating interactive or static graphical visualizations or textual summaries
## Chapter 2. Python Language Basics, IPythom, and Jupyter Notebooks
- Python is an interpreted language, so an interpreter will run a program by executing one statement at a time
- IPython: an enhanced Python interpreter
- Jupyter notebook: web-based code notebooks originally created within the IPython project
- Running the IPython Shell:
  - use the ipython command
- Running the Jupyter Notebook:
  - Run the command jupyter notebook in a terminal 
  - file with extension .ipynb
- Introspection
  - using a question mark before or after a variable will display some general information about the object
- %run command 
  - runa ny file as a python program inside IPython session
  - in Jupyter notebook, can use the related %load magic function:
  - this imports a script into a code cell
- to interrupt running code, press Ctrl-C
